Answers to questions people might reasonably ask on a visit to my site:

### Why are you doing this?

I am here to write and have fun doing it. If it is useful or entertaining for
the reader, all the better.

### What does "Vs Dyslexior" mean?

**Dys-lex-i-or** _noun_: the personification of dyslexia manifest.

A friend of mine, brilliantly, coined the name Dyslexior while we were at school
together. "No it's not you" she said, encouragingly, as I raged, typo after typo
while writing up some miserable homework assignment. "It's that mischievous
fiend: I call him Dylsexior, he's struck again! Damn you Dyslexior!". At
least, that's how I imagine it went down - it has been a while and neither of us
remember exactly.

Since then the concept has been percolating subconciously. This Dyslexior
character, what's he all about? Tyrannical or misunderstood? Undeniably
aggravating and at times he takes to looming menacingly. I wonder, is he my
Nemesis?

Sometimes I imagine he is my shadow, and In quieter moments we are okay him and
I, best friends even, after all there is plenty thatâ€™s good in him. It is just that,
every so often, the relationship disintegrates and erupts into an all out boss fight.
 
### What are your posts about?

The advice for the prospective writer is to write about what grabs you. This is
doubly so for the dyslexic. While you can see there is a loose theme, I imagine
that the scope of my writing will wonder freely (idly?), stopping only for
brief moments, to take a closer look at some glint of fancy before swinging a
foot off brazenly in the opposite direction. Dyslexior may at such moments appear to
have become some distant memory. Bear in mind - dyslexia is life long. The
struggle is right here and now. In such seemingly quiet moments if you are
affected similarly, take encouragement in every act of both reading and writing.

Also, a side note here: I don't intend to have a comments thread on this site.
On this point I would like to echo the brilliant [Ursula Le Guin](
https://www.ursulakleguin.com/blog/0-a-note-at-the-beginning).

However, I do include my email for anyone who would like to connect. Further,
if you spot a typo or anything of that nature, please, let me know.

### How is the site organised?

There are two main threads to this site (coming as of 4.10.21), the first is a personal blog with
standard posts, the second deals with quests and follows my adventures in
education, work and any pursuit that captures my imagination.
