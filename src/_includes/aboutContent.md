# Why?

That underscore in the title of the landing page. _vsDyslexior. is an
invitation. My belief: reading, writing they don't come easy to alot of us. The
truth of the matter as I see it is there is much to be gained in going head to
head with our weakness at every stage well into the most complex materials and
all the way into our twiglht years. With so much to be gained, why would we ever
stop learning or think that it is not for us? And, equally once something is
learnt why not share!?

And so I want to write and document my experiances (the highs, the lows, crushing blows
and maybe once in every so often triumphes). What might make this interesting
(as you may have already deduced) are my struggles with dyslexia.

#VS Dyslexior?

A friend of mine coined, quite brilliantly, the name Dyslexior while we where
teenagers. "Damn you Dylsexior, struck again!". Recently it has been an idea
that I keep coming back to. This character, perhaps tyranical, perhaps
misunderstood but definatley aggrivating at times, looms at moments in my life.
Our nemisis? I wonder, perhaps I see him more as my shadow. I think for the most
part we are okay, maybe even best friends, it is just every so often the
relationship errupts into a boss fight.

#How?

There are two threads to this site. One a personal blog, traditional posts. The
other post type "quests" follow my asperations in education work and most any
pursuit that captures my imagination.

I do not intend to have a comments thread on this site I would echo the
brilliant Urula Le Guine here
https://www.ursulakleguin.com/blog/0-a-note-at-the-beginning on this point.

However, I do include my email for anyone who would like to connect (let me know
about typos!).

#More why! An email to my Latin teacher:


Yesterday you mentioned the social side of dyslexia, and in the moment, I forgot a few interesting points on the subject, and also understated how much "Overcoming Dyslexia" does in fact deal with it. (The science accounts for perhaps a fifth of the book). However, if you wouldn’t mind, you have inspired me, and I would like to expand on what was said in the lesson.



There is a little book from the 70s by Herbert Kohl titled "Reading, how to.", which opens with the line; "There is no reading problem." what continues is an approach to teaching that just so happens, quite brilliantly, to be harmonious with Dr. Shaywitz’s ideas on how to teach the dyslexic student. Kohl’s book also makes the case that the problem, rather than within the student, is within society, the norms of educational institutions and the ideas around education itself. His approach is inspiring, has to be said. Frustratingly he dismisses the importance of a diagnosis of dyslexia. This is unfortunate as an understanding of dyslexia is empowering knowledge for the individual affected by it. (I speak here from very recent personal experience. Prompted by a question you asked me at the beginning of our lessons; how does dyslexia affect you?’ Thank you, thank you, thank you!)



On from this - there is a lack of understanding of what dyslexia, in fact, is. That is, an unexpected difficulty with reading, in an otherwise perfectly intelligent student, caused by complications in the decoding of words; more specifically, the processing of phonemes. This lack of understanding can easily lead people to misinformed conclusions such as "dyslexia isn’t real" etc. Perhaps the struggle here is with the "unexpected" part? Further, If not read carefully, you might conclude the same from Kohl and others like him. However, I believe, in this case, that interpretation is misguided from the author's intent, which is sympathetic to, and aligned with, the struggling reader. More importantly, in the message from both Kohl and Shaywitz there is a call for action, the dismissal of which is a cruel oversight. Thankfully, due to the work at Yale (Dr. Shaywitz’s again), the growing evidence from research replicated around the world and helped by developments in fMIR technology, we can shoot that myth in the head and bury it in a shallow unmarked grave along with all the distress, the anxiety and confusion that accompanies it. (Apologies for the graphics, you can tell; I am moved by the subject matter.)



Even more pernicious than the above is the myth that "dyslexia is a middle class condition". The implication being that it is just privileged, overly fussy, parents looking for an excuse for their underperforming children. While we see that, yes, there are more children in the middle class diagnosed with dyslexia, this is more accurately explained by children in the working class and minority groups etc. being overlooked for referral and consequently being drastically under diagnosed. This is rather close to my heart, its interpretation directly challenges assumptions we make about what people different from us can and can’t achieve. A problem that can very easily go unnoticed, in a busy classroom, by well-intentioned teachers that simply lack awareness, skills and understanding (not to mention time) to tackle the issue. I am fortunate to have had the support that I did when I was young - the question is: what about all the others? What potential is being overlooked, slipping through the cracks, lost to needless struggle? Conservative estimates suggest that dyslexia will affect one in twenty of us, Dr. Shaywitz puts it at one in five.



Currently, my hypothesis is that dyslexia is an extreme expression of a difficulty that is experienced in some way, along a continuum, by many, if not all learners. As such, understanding of how to teach the dyslexic learner and the accommodations needed for him to realise his full potential, will ultimately be of benefit to everyone.



Finally, I would like to add, overall both books' primary focus, quite practically, is on the struggles with learning to read and social issues faced in and around the classroom. However, I can't help but think, they allude (more implicitly) to wider social issues - do we want an educated public? - and other such questions related to attitudes towards intellectual aspiration. It is notable that the best reading and research I have found on dyslexia (these books included) comes from America. Closer to home, there is a twist of fate; I am passionate about learning and reading, a characteristic, that is to my experience, shared among many dyslexics.



I like the sound of the two books together: ‘Reading, how to.’ (A guide to) ‘Overcoming dyslexia’ : ‘There is no reading problem’!



After all, don't we all want to be able to read and to enjoy (reap?) the, multus - multa - multum benefits that come from it?



Thank you for taking an interest in all this, it is very helpful.



All the best,

Ewan
