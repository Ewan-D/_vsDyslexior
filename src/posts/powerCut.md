I made these during a powercut last night. Here they are, the music uses a
sample from the radio that same night with an op1 backing; fm synthesis plus
sampled piano, and a 6B pencil drawing, abstract figures point to an embryo
hanging above the void. I don't know. Things feel different when there is no
electricity. The dark is darker and the sound of the birds outside is clearer.
