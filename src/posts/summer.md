Neurons like the 'butterflies of the soul'. I have been looking through drawings
by Ramo Y Cajal, and then drew the above. Scanned in into the computer and put
it through Inkscape.

This is my first post since I had covid. Coming out of that, I got stuck into
writing the program/game/app I had imagined for helping me learn languages. Not
entirely unrelated to my interest in Ramo Y Cajal's drawings. Essential it is a
(another) flashcard making app. It is meant to push connections between words
and meanings beyond just translation. So: synonyms, contraries, roots, examples
etc can be made added to each 'card' as well as drawings and audio recordings.
Unlike the majority of what is available already the app is entirely down to the
user entering all the information. (I wouldn't know how to program something
like that at the moment anyway!) I am hoping that this will give the user a
sense of owner ship over what is going on in their learning and maybe even
something to look back on. This is unlike my experience so far of other similar
apps where the users role feels way more passive.

That is were I am up too and over the summer I am going to be testing it out
before I push it to github etc.

I am rambling musing on what comes next - in the mean time have some more
music... synths on side A pianos on B.
