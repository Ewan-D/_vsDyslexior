Neurons like the 'butterflies of the soul'. I have been looking through drawings
by Ramo Y Cajal. Inspired, I then drew what you can see above. Scanned it in into
the computer and put it through Inkscape.

This is my first post since I had covid. Coming out of that, I got stuck into
writing the program/game/app I had imagined for helping me learn languages. Not
entirely unrelated to my interest in Ramo Y Cajal's drawings. Imagine neurons
reaching out like leaves at the end of branches in the breeze. Essentially I am
making another flashcard app. My hope is to encourage connections between words
and their meanings beyond translation. So: synonyms, contraries, roots, example
sentences etc. can all be added to each 'flash card' and, as well, drawings and
audio recordings. Unlike the majority of what is available already the app is
entirely down to the user entering all of the information. (I wouldn't know how
to program something more sophisticated anyway!) I am hoping that this will give
the user a sense of owner ship over what is going on in their learning and maybe
even something to look back on and continually add to and refine. This is unlike
my experience so far of other flash card apps where the users role feels way
more passive.

Imagine each word as a node connected to all the others... like a neuron!? Hmm
maybe.

That is were I am up too, and over the summer, I am going to be testing it out and
fixing bugs before I push it to github etc.

I am rambling musing on what comes next - in the mean time have some more
music... synths on side A pianos on B.
