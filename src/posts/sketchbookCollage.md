A collage of pictures taken from sketchbooks I have been using this year. Going
around in a circle clock wise from the bottom left corner: drawn from a photo of
me when I was about 9 or so at my Grandparents house in Devon, then another
portrait of me now age 34 at home in Burgate, the young terrified cheetah I
found in a National geographic story. The story covered the black market selling
of cheetahs, people want them for pets. Finally, the background is a doodle I
did on the way back from Paris this November.

I get a mixture of feelings looking at this image. The way I am still resting my
foot on its side while sitting in a chair. The hot breath from the cheetah,
panic in his eyes, taken from his home. The emotional tug of wanting to help
strains against feeling helpless and looking on. The background looking up into
outer space.
