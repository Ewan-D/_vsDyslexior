{%image "CallToAction.png", "line drawing of fairy pointing at phone and me in bed trying to answer with the word January written in the corner" %}


A call to adventure! I thought about this image in a few ways - falling from the
sky was one. Falling from the sky while being handed the phone. I think though,
the above gets close to how I feel this month. Surreal, like I am just
waking up, my imagination ready to go and my body, cosy, relucntantly moving
towards the phone. The word January helps complete it in my mind.

The two tracks below where fun to put together as well. I wonder if they align.
