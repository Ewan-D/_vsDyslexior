{%image "CallToAction.png", "line drawing of fairy pointing at phone and me in bed trying to answer with the word January written in the corner" %}


A call to adventure. I thought about this image in a few ways - falling from the
sky was one. Falling from the sky while being handed the phone. But the above
gets close to how I feel this month. Surreal, just waking up, my imagination
ready to go and demanding my body, cosy, relucntantly to move towards the phone.
Take the call! I think the word January helps complete it.

The two tracks below where fun to put together as well. Detuned and wonky, I
wonder if they align?
