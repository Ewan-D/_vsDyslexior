I really like to read Ursula Guine so I was plesently surprised when I found a
little quote of hers that could be translated into a little kind of function
type ting...



``` js
let whatNext = (action, profitable) => {
   if(action != profitable){
	   return 'gather information';
    }else{
	   return 'sleep';
   };
};

console.log(whatNext(1 ,0);

```
