Cassette tapes, chunky, clunky and joyful. Squeezing down on both play and
record until the buttons crunched home. The reels whirring, as they spun,
winding magnetic tape, threading through, side a to b, spool to spool. I would
carry three or four of them at a time, at school. Loose among my notebooks and
planners, they rattled around and picked up the smell of old apples left
uneaten, fermenting at the bottom of my backpack. Pink Floyd, Nirvana, some
Pixies and a dream of casting them aside for a click wheel iPod with the blue
backlight. And now, I stick solely to mp3s and other such digital formats. Like
the rest of the world, I have moved on. But, as convenient as they may be, mp3s
won't ever offer that same analogue charm.

So, feeling nostalgic, and inspired by the design of the Op1, I have started making a
cassette player for the browser. This is what I have to offer so far by way of a
throw back (if you are viewing this on mobile switch to landscape for the full experience!):

<audio id="song"><source src="{{ '/posts/plinkReverse.mp3' | url }}"/></audio>
<audio id="songB"><source src="{{ '/posts/combingExperimentOP1.mp3' | url }}"/></audio>
{% include "audio.njk" %}

Hi, my name is Ewan. I make music, art and do a bit of programming too. I wanted
to combine all that in a blog and so here we are! (More in the About page.)

This is my first ever post. I am sure all the standard hall marks are here:
clumsiness, awkwardness and a idle approach to putting out posts...
enjoy :smile: E
