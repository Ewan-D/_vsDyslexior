Waking up, blinking as the light picks out motes of dust across the sunlight
that filters in through the gaps in the curtains. I cough a little and turn
pulling a woolen throw about me that is ever to slightly to small and the
movement leaves my feet open to the cold. I groan and wrinkling my noes in
defiance and squint at the red numbers of the beside alarm clock and vaguely
start to do some calculating fighting inwardly all the while. Coffee glasses
work - whats the order again?

This is it a free rambling start to a blog about - wait what is this blog about again?

Forget it I don't think that it matters; I think lets just have some music press play.

Hi, my names ewan I want to make stuff and thought that this would be a good
place to write about it/think about it/put it out there on this thing what we
call the great world wide web.

Oh and this is my first ever post. I am sure all the standard hall marks are here.
