Waking up, blinking at the sunlight as it picks out motes of dust across my room
filtering in through the gaps of the curtains. I cough a little pathetically and
turn pulling a woollen throw about me that is ever to slightly to small and the
movement leaves my feet open to the cold. I groan and wrinkling my noes in
defiance I squint at the red numbers of the bedside alarm clock and vaguely start
to do some calculating fighting inwardly all the while. Coffee, glasses, work,
brush teeth - whats the order again?

This is it folks - welcome to a rambling start to a blog about, about -
wait, what is this blog about again?

Forget it, it is too early to call; and anyway I don't think that it matters.
No, lets just have some music... press play.

Hi, my names ewan I want to make stuff and thought that this would be a good
place to write about it/think about it/put it out there on this thing what we
call the great world wide web.

Oh, and if you can't already tell this is my first ever post. I am sure all the
standard hall marks are here. Clumsy awkwardness may be a trade mark oh and also
a idle approach to putting out posts... enjoy :smile: E
