I haven't written anything in a while here and that is because I have been tied
up with work and moving house. I can't quite believe it but between this and my
last post I managed to take a whole new step in life. I am now a home owner?!
What the fuck and how did that happen!?

I am also starting to get to grips with this site and what it is about. This is
as the title says. About me fighting the fight against my nemis Dyslexior. I am
poking fun at it. And having fun with it. In the only ways I know how. The app
idea. Well it just feels to narrow. Maybe I will keep adding to it and all that.
But I want this more to be a personal blog about my successes and failiurs and
all the wonderus specktrum inbetween. Also the art and the music is cool and I
just want to keep that coming.

I would like to broaden out the idea of litracy here. That is where I am at.

I could write more about this winter here but. I think. Je pense que. Maybe not
its now 2023. Well into 2023. I had a birthday. I joined some bands. I left some
bands. I drew a bunch of stuff. And played a bunch of music. And bought a house
next to the sea. onwards.
