I can't quite believe it but between this and my last post I managed to take a
whole new step in life. I am now a home owner! What the fuck and how did that
happen!? Difficult to sum up so I will let the pause in anything else other than
work and house speak for itself here.

Also, starting to get to grips with this site and what it is about. As the sites
name says it's about me fighting against my nemesis Dyslexior - Dyslexia
manifest! I am poking fun at it, having fun with it in the only ways I know how.
So to this end the idea of just focusing on an app, it just feels to narrow.
Maybe I will keep adding to it and all that. I want this site to be a personal
blog about my successes and failures and all the wondrous spectrum in-between.
Also the art and the music is cool and I just want to keep that coming. In
short, you know... a blog.

Another thing I have been thinking about: what the hell is meant by literacy
anyway? In schools and in life and more personally. What is in this word!?

I could write more about this winter here but, je pense que, maybe not its now
2023, well into 2023. I had a birthday. I joined some bands. I left some bands.
I drew a bunch of stuff, and played a bunch of music. And bought a house next to
the sea.
