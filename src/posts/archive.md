And also ideas for secondary phase 


All those years ago when I started this site I wrote this on the front page:

>"Other than a blog, with music and art, I can't tell you exactly
>what I am doing with this site. That, I am discovering as I go along. Maybe
>after the next post I'll have it. For now I just want to work with it. As
>such, I am calling this the primary phase. There are some posts below that you can

>well, my first attempt at pinning down the whats and the whys etc."

This is what it used to look like:

{% image "archiveForVsDyslexior.png", "a picture of the original site look" %}

I am starting secondary phase now... simply put it'll be more of a blog. Why are
the obvious things the hardest? 

List of things I would like to do: 

1. It would be nice if the picture on the front automatically updated from the
latest post. 
2. And as well be able to wonder around the site with the music playing as an
option. 
3. A game, bien sur! Just a side thought here for my future self - I wonder if
copilot has gotten better at gd script? That could help with all this. 
4. Also more illustrations like that one in the snap shot above... its fun to
have them looking like they are interacting/looking at the site. 
5. Generally make it more fun for you the wondering reader - and also a link to
my YouTube page should you feel like it.
6. Maybe some mention of being a teacher?
7. Also a new audio player this is what the old one looks like:

{% include "audio.njk" %}
Give me a couple of months and let me at it... see ya later.
