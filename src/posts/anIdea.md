This could be it you know! It could take a very long while. But this is what I
am thinking: EwanvsDyslexior is a game. like a computer game. I mean it sounds
like it and that is kinda what I was thinking however I never really had it down
until I started thinking about what it is that I am actually doing. It is game
that aims to get you into reading and writing in a second language. And being as
I am dyslexic that comes with its own challenges. But all that aside the aim is
to get the player too the litrature and culture that they are studying.
Representing the toughest challenge I have ever engaged with.

Seems like a fun thing. I will just leave it there ticking away for a bit and
see how things develop. If I am still into it 6 months from now etc.
