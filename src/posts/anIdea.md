An idea has landed and in this mist is starting to take form... It could take a
very long while. But this is what I have been thinking: a game, a computer game.
Its aim to get you into reading and writing in a second language. Being as I am
dyslexic that obviously comes with its own challenges. Get the player too the
litrature and culture etc. Seems like a fun and cool thing.

I mean if I can learn another language then its possible no matter the presence
of Dyslexior! Hmm, this is starting to sound like a hypthosis turned into a boss
fight.

Is it possible? Who cares you got nothing to loose.

I will just leave it there for now ticking away for a bit and see how things
develop. If I am still into it 6 months from now etc. Then maybe this is a real
thing.
