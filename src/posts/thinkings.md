Hi, this is my second post on ewanvsdyslexior and I haven't as yet explained
anything about the site or myself. The first post was a bit of music I
scrambled together along with a some narrative type writing. I am not sure at this
stage even which tense I would like to use. All I have at this stage is some
sort of motivation to write, and as well, a idea that is kinda murky that I want
to thrash out. To add to this I also am tying in allot of passions... well four
really; art, music & computers.

I remember reading some where that it can be usefull to talk about yourself in
the third person which planted a seed. I think that it was intended to be
theraputic...

Mainly though I am here to figure stuff out, heads up it will be messy. But it
could as well be the catalyst or testing ground even for something more. Maybe
that is the best way for me to go about thinking about all this. Do you ever get
hung up so much on presenting things perfectly all the time so that you never
get around to putting anything out even though you wish that you would? Well
that is me. a bit of me anyways. And maybe this will be part of the solution.

Questions we might have at this stage: who is ewan? who is dyslexior? and what
is the vs all about? All good and relevent, although I feel like I am outta time
on this one for now.

This post is for Missy - the best dog ever.
