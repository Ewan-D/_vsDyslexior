altered this post on the 20th March removing one of the pictures and adding some
different text.

Also, a quick portrait sketched in the hotel room in sidmouth I was staying in.
We were there to scatter my Grandma's and Grandad's ashes on the beach. I had a
view of the channel from my room and spent a fair amount of time daydreaming
while watching the waves on the other side of the glass.

Fond the op1 recording below from lockdown 2020 today while I was putting this
post together and was surprised to hear my voice in there. Takes a little while
for side A to get started...
