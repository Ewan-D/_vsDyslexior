Below are some new drawings I scanned them into the computer a couple of days ago. a Zoom call, in a hotel in devon and my right hand freely drawing the contour of my left.

Zoom, screen, meeting. There is some music down at the bottom of this post as well.

I recorded it in lockdown. Found it today while I was putting this together and was surprised to hear my voice in there.
