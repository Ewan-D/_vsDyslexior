<p class="py-2"> Other than a blog, with music and art, I can't tell you exactly
what I am doing with this site. That I am discovering as I go along. Maybe
after the next post I'll have it. For now, I just want to work with it. As
such, I am calling this the primary phase. There are some posts below that you can
help yourself too and an about page which gives the gist of its origins and, as
well, my first attempt at pinning down the whats and the whys etc.</p>
